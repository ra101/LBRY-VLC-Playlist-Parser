# LBRY VLC Playlist Parser

This addon will allow [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to open any free [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv/) video direct from the link.

**Why Create this, when LBRY Desktop app already exists?**

~~For VLC key-binding... idk... I had nothing better to do...~~

Helps a lot on older CPUs that cannot run the LBRY streams in the browser.
